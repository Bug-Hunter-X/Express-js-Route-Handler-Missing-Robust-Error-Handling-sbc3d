This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails to properly handle cases where the user ID is invalid (e.g., not a number, not found). This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in production. The `bugSolution.js` provides an improved version with comprehensive error handling, including input validation and more informative error responses.
